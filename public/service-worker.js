// This generated service worker JavaScript will precache your site's resources.
// The code needs to be saved in a .js file at the top-level of your site, and registered
// from your pages in order to be used. See
// https://github.com/googlechrome/sw-precache/blob/master/demo/app/js/service-worker-registration.js
// for an example of how you can register this script and handle various service worker events.
